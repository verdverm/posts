Hello World
=============

This is my attempt to start [blogging][blog]. At least I have an account now.
The hurdle is a little smaller. The real key is to write every day,
or so I’m told. Do 10,000 hours of anything and you will obtain master level.
I’m not going to write here every day, only mostly polished pieces.
I need to learn editing skills too. Any recommendations?


So prepare for the ramblings of my philosophies, knowledge, and interests.
Get the book “Conquest of Mind” by Eknath Easwaran.
And the book "Godel, Escher, Bach" by Douglas Hofstadter.

Cheers!

Tony
